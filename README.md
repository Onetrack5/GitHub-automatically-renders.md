🚀 Usage
- Run as Administrator
Many steps (restore point, DISM/SFC, service stops, bloatware removal) require elevation.
- Choose a Mode
- Click Quick Cleanup for safe, fast steps.
- Click Deep Maintenance for all steps, including deep repair.
- Adjust Selections
Manually check/uncheck any steps.
- Start Cleanup
- Press Start or hit Alt+S.
- Watch the log for progress.
- Cancel anytime with Cancel.
- Review Summary
See freed space, time taken, and open the log.

⚠️ Notes
- DISM/SFC are long‑running repairs (10–40+ minutes) and require internet for DISM.
They are unchecked by default — enable only when needed.
- First run creates %APPDATA%\DeepCleanup for settings and profiles.
- If the window opens off‑screen (multi‑monitor change), delete settings.json in %APPDATA%\DeepCleanup.
